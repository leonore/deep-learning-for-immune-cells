# QUESTIONS FOR SUPERVISOR MEETINGS

## Week 2 meeting - Mo 30/09
* Do you prefer Github or Gitlab repo? I prefer Gitlab issues but don't know if I could also use external - e.g. Trello?
* Can the data (extracts) be updated online, or should it be kept private?
* Why is it important to have both the images and the mask? Is it basically an image label? "ground truth label"
* What is the difference between the black and grey photos?
* Show a photo and ask for description
* We would like a convolutional autoencoder?

## Week 3 meeting - Tue 07/10
* What resolution should I aim for?
* What exactly are we trying to predict? Do we want to apply clustering algorithm to both red and green images and then see how they overlap, or do we want to do it on the brightfield images?

## Week 4 meeting - by email
- Should I keep a copy of the outputs whenever I change a parameter?
