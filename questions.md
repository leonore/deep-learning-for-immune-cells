# QUESTIONS FOR SUPERVISOR MEETINGS

## Week 2 meeting - Mo 30/09
* Do you prefer Github or Gitlab repo? I prefer Gitlab issues but don't know if I could also use external - e.g. Trello?
* Can the data (extracts) be updated online, or should it be kept private?
* Why is it important to have both the images and the mask? Is it basically an image label? "ground truth label"
* What is the difference between the black and grey photos?
* Show a photo and ask for description
* We would like a convolutional autoencoder?
