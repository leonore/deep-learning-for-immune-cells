%% ABSTRACT
\begin{abstract}
    The protective responses of our immune system are initiated by interactions between immune cells. These interactions can be inhibited or enhanced by the application of drugs. This project investigated using deep learning models to analyse microscope images of immune cells to study their interactions under different experimental conditions. Deep learning has scarcely been applied in the field of immunology. We implemented and evaluated a convolutional autoencoder and an autoencoder-based regression model to qualitatively and quantitatively analyse the interaction between T cells and dendritic cells in microscope images. We found that the autoencoder helped speed up the process of data visualisation and that the regression model successfully predicted measures of interaction in unseen images of immune cells. With carefully selected and pre-processed datasets, deep learning can be a useful technique for immunology researchers to analyse immune cell interaction.

%% Notes on formatting
%==============================================================================
% The first page, abstract and table of contents are numbered using Roman numerals and are not
% included in the page count. 
%
% From now on pages are numbered
% using Arabic numerals. Therefore, immediately after the first call to \chapter we need the call
% \pagenumbering{arabic} and this should be called once only in the document. 
%
% Do not alter the bibliography style.
%
% The first Chapter should then be on page 1. You are allowed 40 pages for a 40 credit project and 30 pages for a 
% 20 credit report. This includes everything numbered in Arabic numerals (excluding front matter) up
% to but excluding the appendices and bibliography.
%
% You must not alter text size (it is currently 10pt) or alter margins or spacing.
