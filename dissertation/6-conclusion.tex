\chapter{Conclusion}

The purpose of our research was to apply deep learning methods to images of immune cells and evaluate whether or not a deep learning approach could be successfully applied to the analysis of interaction between different types of immune cells.

For this, we implemented a convolutional autoencoder from which we implemented a regression model. We wanted to use the autoencoder's power at dimensionality reduction to attempt to visualise the structure of the imaging data, as well as use it to build a powerful regression model capable of predicting a value of interaction from an image of immune cells.

Our evaluation of these two models has shown that there is potential in using deep learning methods for imaging data of immune cells, following in the footpath of similar research done in cancer research. While we could not successfully find an inherent structure to the data using a UMAP projection, we showed that a regression model could predict a value of interaction well from an image with a best RMSE score of 1.161 $\pm 4.732$ on a background-corrected dataset containing images from all our categories. Moreover, our images were taken in the context of multiple experimental variable. When these were limited to one variable, UMAP seemed to find something closer to a structure.

With appropriate processing and further research into different deep learning models, these could allow researchers to uncover new trends in their dataset of immune cells for analysing interaction.

\section{Future work}

There is a number of different routes that could still be explored. Firstly, we only explored one size of sub-images in our pre-processing. A bigger size of sliding window could include more details of the images and allow for a better global overview of the impact of experimental conditions on immune cells. As such, a collection of bigger sub-images might have an easier structure that an algorithm such as UMAP could analyse.

Furthermore, we only evaluated one metric for our regression task, which was the percentage of overlap represented by the intersection-over-union metric. This represents some issues in simplicity of analysis. Indeed, a large clustering of T-cells around a dendritic cell \textit{without overlap} could also signify a level of interaction, without overlap being observed. Moreover, we are using a two-dimensional view of the cells. Two different types of cells overlapping might not mean that they are interacting. A T-cell could simply be sitting on top of a dendritic cell, without communication happening between the two.

Finally, we have briefly touched upon the U-Net model. Our dataset gave us access to pre-segmented pictures of immune cells. However, we could use this wealth of pre-segmented data to train a U-Net model to segment T-cells and dendritic cells object in greyscale images.
