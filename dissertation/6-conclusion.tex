\section{Future work}

\begin{itemize}
    \item UNet: we have access to pre-segmented pictures of immune cells. We could train a UNet model to be able to use these pictures and try segment other pictures of DCs/T-cells which have not been separated by dyes.
    \item Bigger sliding window size
    \item Different measures of interaction: issue with the two-dimensional view of the immune cells: they could just be sitting on top of each other, without actually interacting. Moreover, close proximity (not just overlap) could also be a sign of interaction?
\end{itemize}
