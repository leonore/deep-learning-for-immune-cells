\section{Motivation}

Picture your immune system as a speed date. Your immune cells go on quick dates with other immune cells, who tell them about their life. The immune cells might be more or less under the influence of substances. The success of the discussion between the two immune cells during their speed date determines how your immune system is going to react as a whole. The consumption of substances might help make the reaction more positive, or might make a situation worse. Your immune system might be pleased with the date, and react positively, or an immune cell might get offended by their date, and trigger a negative response. % These dates could happen very fast with immune cells moving on to their next date, but could also be prolonged into longer relationships.

%The two partners we are studying are T cells and dendritic cells. 
%long-term, non monogamous

% biological response
Formally put, the initiation of an immune response in our immune system depends on the interaction strength between different types of immune cells. Certain types of immune cells relay information about their environment to other types immune cells, who can then trigger an appropriate response depending on the what they have learned from the other cell about the environment. The environment might contain substances like foreign, dangerous bodies. These interactions between immune cells can be enhanced or inhibited by the application of drugs. Studying the reactions of immune cells under the influence different types of drugs is key in the development of drugs for diseases such as viral infections or auto-immune diseases. 

\section{General problem and our idea}

One way of studying the interaction of immune cells is through microscopic images obtained in artificial settings. We can place immune cells in a dish and study them under a microscope under different experimental conditions, which could be different types of drugs being injected into the dish. Microscopic images of these cells can then be systematically captured.

We are however not interested in how these images are captured, but how they can be analysed. Microscopic images are often analysed with proprietary software which is costly to maintain and whose inner workings are hard to understand. On the other hand, applying deep learning techniques to biomedical data is becoming increasingly popular and more accessible, while obtaining promising results. The problem we are looking at is applying deep learning to the analysis of images of immune cells. We want to explore how deep learning could be used to systematically explore immune cell interaction from microscopic images. The aim is to assess whether using deep learning in the field of immunology can provide any useful information on interaction levels between immune cells under different experimental conditions.
