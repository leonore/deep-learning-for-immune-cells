* Download images of cells from OneDrive
* Familiarise self with images
* Read into UNet for cell segmenting
* Read into autoencoders

* **Week 2**
* Setup training data
   * Resize images and convert to JPEG
* Setup an autoencoder
* Run images through autoencoder

* **Week 3**
* Setup Trello board
* Build dissertation, solve any problems
* Make function to display fluorescent images correctly
* Transfer fluorescent images to dataset
* Resize dataset and create converted dataset
* Run autoencoder on data, make sure it works
* Split dataset into training, validation to test autoencoder performance

* **Week 4**
* Reworking autoencoder to make sure it works

* **Week 5**
* Reworking autoencoder to make sure it works
