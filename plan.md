Week-by-week plan for the whole project.

## Winter semester

* **Week 1**
* Download ImageJ Fiji for viewing images of cells
* Download images of cells from OneDrive
* Familiarise self with images
* Read into UNet for cell segmenting
* Read into autoencoders

* **Week 2**
* Setup training data
   * Resize images and convert to JPEG
* Setup an autoencoder
* Run images through autoencoder

* **Week 3**
* Setup Trello board
* Build dissertation, solve any problems
* Transfer fluorescent images to dataset
* Run autoencoder on data, make sure it works
* Follow tutorial on clustering algorithm to familiarise with it

* **Week 4**
* Split dataset into training, validation to test autoencoder performance
* Familiarise with calculating overlap of images
* Use compressed representation of images obtained from autoencoder to calculate overlap

* **Week 5**
* Run overlap data through a clustering algorithm
* Start tuning models to improve performance
