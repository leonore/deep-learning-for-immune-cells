# Summer work

* Deep learning for analysing immune cell interactions
* Leonore Papaloizos
* 2264897v
* Carol Webster

## Research completed

* I read most of "Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn & Tensorflow" by GÃ©ron. I was able to relate a lot of topics in the book to topics covered in Data Fundamentals and Text as Data, as well as to my experience with Keras from my level 3 project
* I had a small look at Chollet's "Deep Learning with Python" notebooks, and read through the ones on convolutional neural networks (for small datasets/pretrained ones)
* I watched the video on immunology: "The immune system: looking for love in all the right places"

## Concerns or risks identified

* My main concern when I was reading the book was just the amount of time training the model on the cell images would take, or how big the images would be
