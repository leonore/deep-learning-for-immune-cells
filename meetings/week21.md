# Week 21 (8) meeting minutes - Tues 3rd March 2020

- I have now finished my code, apart from slight tweaks. This meeting was mostly about going over my dissertation structure and any feedback.

- In my introduction there will be both a biological motivation and a technical motivation
  - From my own research I haven't seen autoencoders being applied in the context of immune cells.
  - So there is some technical motivation here.
  - We also have a large amount of data available that we can apply multiple deep learning techniques to for analysis.
  - The biological motivation is the exploration of interaction levels under different experimental conditions.

- In the background section, I was a bit unsure about what to include.
  - For the immunology side, the paper that Hannah showed us a couple weeks back is good to have.
    - She will look for some more general papers to give me.
    - I can't exactly give too much detail away about their experiment as it hasn't been published yet.
  - For the technology side, there are a lot of papers for autoencoders, image segmentation, etc.
    - Carol said to keep it simple and cite the original paper e.g. for autoencoders, t-sne when possible.
    - And then mention some other research if it is particularly applicable.

  - I then went over the other sections, for which there was less comments.
    - For my evaluation section, Carol mentioned I could add in something about the live visualisation graph that I built.
