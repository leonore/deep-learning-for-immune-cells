# Week 12 meeting minutes - 12th December 2019

* I reported on my progress with pre-processing the images yielding much better results with the autoencoder. I said that I would evaluate the performance of the autoencoder when the images are clipped such that there is no values below 255, as Hannah said these cells were not of interest and are no longer being added in new plates made
* I clarified what the next steps would be
  * the aim with the clustering is to see whether we can get a clustering around drug conditions, we do not need to calculate overlap
  * once that part of the research is done, I can look into image segmentation techniques as mentioned in my last meeting with Carol
