# Week 10 meeting minutes - 20 November 2019

* I showed my code to Carol so that I could talk through any problems I was having and give her a better idea of my progress.
* I explained to her the structure of my notebook
* I showed that my encoder and decoder models did not seem to change weights; she suggested this might be because of the lack of training data
  * She suggested I try data augmentation as a 1300 image training dataset is still quite small
* She also advised to evaluate how I was doing by running my code against a dataset we have good results for, e.g. MNIST or CIFAR10
* Right now with the encoded images I am getting a different result from the baseline performance, so something is happening. I should keep track of all my parameter changes.
