# Week 7 meeting minutes - 7 November 2019

- I highlighted the fact that changing the normalisation process for the images revealed that the autoencoder was not working the same anymore.
- I was planning on following a tutorial for PCA+tsne on the MNIST dataset, and I read an article comparing the performance of UMAP to tsne. I suggested that I would follow a similar tutorial, but with UMAP, to get baseline performance. Carol agreed this was a good idea.
- Carol suggested that as I go along, reading about different algorithms, it would be good to write down a description of the algorithm not only for the dissertation, but for my understanding. I agreed.
- Over the next week I will work on separating the DMSO data from the dataset and moving the data to Colab, and following the tutorials as planned.
