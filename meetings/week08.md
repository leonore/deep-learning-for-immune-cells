# Week 8 meeting minutes - 13 November 2019

- I showed my progress with testing PCA/t-sne/UMAP algorithms on MNIST dataset, and then on my own dataset. They yield good results (UMAP being best) on MNIST, but less conclusive on the full cell dataset. However, it does seem to pickup some clusters in the DMSO dataset.
  - Hannah will look into getting me more DMSO images as a bigger dataset might yield better results.
- Using my autoencoder + t-sne yields some good clusters for MNIST.
- Now that I have labelled the full dataset that was provided to me, I am going to tune the algorithms in order to see if I can get better results.
