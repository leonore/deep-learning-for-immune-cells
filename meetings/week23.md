# Week 23 (10) meeting minutes - Wed 18th March 2020

* The dissertation is now due on April 6th. The presentation is now to be delivered as a video on the same date.
  * Next week I will have presentation slides ready so I can deliver it as if it was the video.

* Prior to the meeting, I sent Hannah and Carol my first draft for introduction + background + materials and methods. This meeting is mostly about going over some issues I've had while writing.

* What does CK stand for? -> Chantel Kaiser, the name of the woman who ran the experiments for those plates. Not relevant.
* What is the scale of the microscopic images? The software doesn't actually give you scale, but Hannah calculated that 1px = 1.34 microns (10**-6). This comes from the measurement that T-cells are about 8 microns.
  * Carol said I should add a scale to my figures.

* How much detail to add for t-SNE and UMAP? -> provide a reference to the original paper for mathematical details, as well as handy guides/tutorials for someone wanting to look more into it. The comparison from UMAP's paper is good.

* How many papers to cite for machine learning/deep learning uses in immunology? -> A general review paper for deep learning + machine learning is good, gives someone the opportunity to look into it.

* For the experimental details behind the images, Hannah will send over some papers.

* As the paper for the research behind the images hasn't been published yet, I can't exactly publish a sample of the dataset online, but Hannah will send me over some images that have been captured by students to which I can apply data augmentation, just to show the software is runnable.
