# Week 24 (11) meeting minutes - Wed 25th March 2020

* I started the meeting by going over some grey areas in my dissertation.
  * I highlighted the UNet section (which I have yet to write), asking if this seemed like a good place to mention it.
  * Carol suggested I compare UNet prediction performance to K-means --> is it a better tool than K-means for obtaining masks?
  * I then asked for some clarifications about the DMSO dataset. DMSO pictures are just controls, no drugs will have been applied to it.

* I then started running through my first draft presentation, which lasted 12 minutes (2 minutes over time). The presentation is available in the `week24.pdf` slides.

* After listening, Carol and Hannah made the following suggestions:
  * Keep it simple for the immunology background in a couple sentences
  * For the aims of the experiment: separate out the research questions, and at the very last slide, put these questions up again, and see if they have been answered
  * 'tell us and tell us what you just told us' --> keep reiterating
  * visualisation: 'we were expecting 3 clusters but got...'
  * use I as pronoun
  * image patches â†’ make sure you make it clear why you made it in patches
    1. whole image on its own is too big, too much memory
    2. cant see the cells clearly, they're too small
