# Week 1 meeting minutes - 23 September 2019

* We discussed what I had done over the summer, which is summarised in `summer/summer.md`
* Hannah had provided a OneDrive folder of cell images prior to the meeting. We discussed them, what they represented, and how the Excel sheet attached described the different conditions attached to the images
    * the files are TIFF format
    * there is 3 different culture conditions
* For every meeting, we established that I should make a Powerpoint presentation (keep it simple) that would summarise everything I did for that week
* There is a couple approaches we could have to analysing immune cell interaction. For one of them, we would need the mask of the cells obtained in GI by Hannah (Mask R-CNN). If we can't obtain the mask, we could use autoencoders to get an encoding of each of the images, and be able to use a clustering algorithm on that.
* This week, I should have a look at UNet and autoencoders to familiarise myself with the concepts(Carol provided me with some links to resources)
