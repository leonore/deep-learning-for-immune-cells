# Week 25 (12) meeting minutes - Tuesday 31st March 2020

* Final meeting!

* I sent Hannah and Carol my video presentation before the meeting today as it felt truer to the format and less stressful.
  * I should speak slower at the beginning to make sure watchers don't get lost
  * speed dating - add a humorous tone to it
  * phrase the explanation for splitting the image up in a positive way
  * future work: talk about label free experiments (Hannah's suggestion) + feature extraction from the segmented images: size, granularity

* Hannah asked about the clusters I showed in the presentation, I explained what I find in my evaluation; even in clusters I do find there is not that much structure in the images. 

* I had some questions about citation formalities in my dissertation. Otherwise it is almost finished so I sent it to Carol after the meeting for a final checkup.
